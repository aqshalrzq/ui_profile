# UI Profile App (Flutter Project)
Hello, I'm developing a mobile application using Flutter in Android Studio. In this project, I made a case study to create a simple UI profile display. For an app mockup reference, I looked at the profile view in the Twitter app.

### About UI Profile App
This UI Profile application was developed with the aim of deepening my Flutter knowledge for mobile application development. For now, this project is limited to case studies creating views for profiles.

This project will continue to grow and will be updated. Oh yes, there are several features available in this application, including:
- Creating a splash display for the initial mockup
- Launched some of the listed social media links.
- Horizontal slide across multiple widget components
- Added a dialog when exiting the application

### Technology used in UI Profile App
There are several plugins that I use to develop this UI Profile application, including:

- [google_fonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts)
- [url_launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher)

### Open Source UI Profile App
You can use this project and its status is open source in my github repository. If you want to use this project for learning or other things as long as it is used for good, I really like it.

If you want to ask about this project, you can directly contact me on some of my social media in the profile section
